Happy Birthday! Here is your present.

Yes, the present is to get to watch quite a lot of terminal scrawl. I know you
like that.

# We'll need this first
sudo apt-get install git

# Get all the code
git clone https://github.com/cjbackhouse/ropesight.git

cd ropesight

# Get all the other packages we need
make prereq

# Compile the C++ parts
make

# Start the configuration screen
./gui.py




To update to new versions in future:

cd ropesight
git pull
make



Select options in the GUI, "AI" means that the computer will control your bell
too. Press spacebar to pull, q to quit. You can look left and right if you so
desire with the mouse.

Top tip: as with real ringing don't succumb to the temptation not to pull. If
you get a little lost while hunting out you definitely need to press the
spacebar, otherwise the bell may not up far enough at the next stroke.

Start out with some rounds to get the hang of the handling. I also found
ringing plain hunt line over bells still in rounds helpful (mute your sound
maybe, it's going to sound gross).

If you select a method there will be three whole pulls of rounds first.

The computer ringers don't have very good striking right now. Maybe it's to
make you focus on the ropesight. Or maybe it just needs to be fixed...
