Happy Birthday! Here is your present.

Yes, the present is to get to watch quite a lot of terminal scrawl. I know you
like that.

# We'll need this first
sudo apt-get install git

# Get all the code
git clone https://github.com/cjbackhouse/ropesight.git

cd ropesight

# Get all the other packages we need
make prereq

# Compile the C++ parts
make

Start the configuration screen
./gui.py




To update to new versions in future:

cd ropesight
git pull
make
